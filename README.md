# For Developers 
üë®‚Äçüíª This project is developed using [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en) ([Express js](https://expressjs.com/)), [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) and [React](https://react.dev/)

For specific information about the technologies version, see the [package.json](https://github.com/kenn7575/sop-it-service-solution/blob/main/frontend/udl%C3%A5nssystem/package.json) for the frontend and the [package.json](https://github.com/kenn7575/sop-it-service-solution/blob/main/backend/package.json) for the backend.

### Structure
The project is divided into 2 main folders:
- [frontend](https://github.com/kenn7575/sop-it-service-solution/tree/main/frontend) - The frontend of the project.
- [backend](https://github.com/kenn7575/sop-it-service-solution/tree/main/backend) - The backend of the project.

## Installation
### Prerequisites
- [Node js](https://nodejs.org/en) - The backend is written in Node js, so you need to have Node js, installed on your machine.
- [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com/) - The frontend and backend both use npm to manage dependencies, which is installed with Node js by default.
- [MariaDB](https://mariadb.org/) - The database is written in MariaDB, so you need to have MariaDB installed on your machine.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) - The project uses Git for version control, so you need to have Git installed on your machine.

### Environment variables
The project uses environment variables to store sensitive information. You need to create a .env file in the root folder of the project. In the root folder we've included a .env.example file that you can use as a template.

The .env file for the backend should look something like this:

```
NODE_ENV="development" #Nodejs environment. Format: "development" or "production".

DATABASE_URL="database_url" #URL to the database. Format: "mysql://user:password@host:port/database".

FRONTEND_URL="http://localhost:5173" #URL to the frontend. Format: "http://localhost:port,http://localhost:port2".

BACKEND_PORT=3000 #Port the backend should run on. Default: 3000

JWT_SECRET="secret" #Secret used to sign the JWT tokens.

LDAP_HOST="xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx" #IP address of the LDAP server. Format: "xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx".
LDAP_PORT="389" #Port of the LDAP server.
LDAP_USERNAME="username" #Username used to connect to the LDAP server.
LDAP_PASSWORD="password" #Password used to connect to the LDAP server.
LDAP_BASE_DN="base_dn" #Base DN of the LDAP server.
LDAP_USERS="users" #DN of the "regular" users (non-admin) in the LDAP server.
LDAP_ADMINS="admins" #DN of the admins in the LDAP server.

MAIL_MAILER="mailer" #Mailer used to send emails.
MAIL_HOST="host" #Host of the mail server.
MAIL_PORT=587 #Port of the mail server.
MAIL_USERNAME="username" #Username used to connect to the mail server.
MAIL_PASSWORD="password" #Password used to connect to the mail server.
MAIL_ENCRYPTION="tls" #Encryption used to connect to the mail server.
MAIL_FROM_ADDRESS="from_address" #Email address used as the sender of the emails.
MAIL_FROM_NAME="from_name" #Name used as the sender of the emails.
```

The .env file for the frontend should look something like this:

```
VITE_APP_BACKEND_URL="http://localhost:3000/api"
```

### Setup
#### Clone the repository
1. Inside VS code, press "Clone git repository..." and paste the link to this repository. [repo link](https://github.com/kenn7575/sop-it-service-solution).
> You need to have Git installed on your machine for this to work.
2. Choose a location on your machine to clone the repository to.
3. Open the folder in VS code.

#### Install backend dependencies
1. Open a terminal in VS code in the backend folder.
2. Run ```npm run i``` to install the frontend dependencies.
> You need to have Node.js installed on your machine for this to work.
> Watch out for errors in the terminal. If that happend try reading the error message and resolve the issue.

#### Run the backend
1. Open a terminal in VS code in the backend folder
2. Run ```npm run dev``` to start the backend server.
> You need to have Node.js installed on your machine to run the backend.

#### Install frontend dependencies
1. Open a terminal in VS code in the root folder.
2. Run ```npm run i``` to install the frontend dependencies.
> You need to have Node.js installed on your machine for this to work.
> Watch out for errors in the terminal. If that happend try reading the error message and resolve the issue.

#### Run the frontend
1. In a root folder terminal, run ```npm run dev``` to start the frontend server. Or run ```npm run host``` to expose the frontend server to the network.
2. Open the link provided in the terminal to open the frontend in your browser. Typically its gonna be hosted on http://localhost:5173.
> You need to have Node.js installed on your machine to run the frontend. If the frontend crashes or behaves strangely, the backend is probably not running or the .env file has incorrect values.
